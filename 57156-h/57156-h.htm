<div class="chapter"><h2>PREFACE</h2></div>

<p>But for a fantasy of Nathaniel Hawthorne, this play, of course, would
never have been written. In “Mosses from an Old Manse,” the <i>Moralized
Legend</i> “Feathertop” relates, in some twenty pages of its author’s
inimitable style, how Mother Rigby, a reputed witch of old New England
days, converted a corn-patch scarecrow into the semblance of a fine
gentleman of the period; how she despatched this semblance to “play
its part in the great world, where not one man in a hundred, she
affirmed, was gifted with more real substance than itself”; how there
the scarecrow, while paying court to pretty Polly Gookin, the rosy,
simpering daughter of Justice Gookin, discovered its own image in a
looking-glass, returned to Mother Rigby’s cottage, and dissolved into
its original elements.</p>

<p>My indebtedness, therefore, to this source, in undertaking the
present play, goes without saying. Yet it would not be true, either
to Hawthorne’s work or my own, to classify “The Scarecrow” as a
dramatization of “Feathertop.” Were it intended to be such, the many
radical departures from the conception and the treatment of Hawthorne
which are evident in the present work would have to be regarded as so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
many unwarrantable liberties taken with its original material; the
function of the play itself would, in such case, become purely
formal,—translative of a narrative to its appropriate dramatic
form,—and as such, however interesting and commendable an effort,
would have lost all <i>raison d’être</i> for the writer.</p>

<p>But such, I may say, has not been my intention. My aim has been quite
otherwise. Starting with the same basic theme, I have sought to
elaborate it, by my own treatment, to a different and more inclusive
issue.</p>

<p>Without particularizing here the full substance of Hawthorne’s
consummate sketch, which is available to every reader, the divergence I
refer to may be summed up briefly.</p>

<p>The scarecrow Feathertop of Hawthorne is the imaginative epitome
or symbol of human charlatanism, with special emphasis upon the
coxcombry of fashionable society. In his essential superficiality he
is characterized as a fop, “strangely self-satisfied,” with “nobby
little nose thrust into the air.” “And many a fine gentleman,” says
Mother Rigby, “has a pumpkin-head as well as my scarecrow.” His hollow
semblance is the shallowness of a “well-digested conventionalism, which
had incorporated itself thoroughly with his substance and transformed
him into a work of art.” “But the clothes in this case were to be the
making of the man,” and so Mother Rigby, after fitting him out in a
suit of embroidered finery, endows him as a finishing touch “with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
great deal of brass, which she applied to his forehead, thus making it
yellower than before. ‘With that brass alone,’ quoth she, ‘thou canst
pay thy way all over the earth.’”</p>

<p>Similarly, the other characters are sketched by Hawthorne in accord
with this general conception. Pretty Polly Gookin, “tossing her
head and managing her fan” before the mirror, views therein “an
unsubstantial little maid that reflected every gesture and did all the
foolish things that Polly did, but without making her ashamed of them.
In short, it was the fault of pretty Polly’s ability, rather than her
will, if she failed to be as complete an artifice as the illustrious
Feathertop himself.”</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Moralized Legend</i> reveals itself as a satire upon a
restricted artificial phase of society. As such, it runs its brief
course, with all the poetic charm and fanciful suggestiveness
of our great New Englander’s prose style, to its appropriate
<i>dénouement</i>,—the disintegration of its hero.</p>

<p>“‘My poor, dear, pretty Feathertop,’ quoth Mother Rigby, with a rueful
glance at the relics of her ill-fated contrivance, ‘there are thousands
upon thousands of coxcombs and charlatans in the world made up of just
such a jumble of worn-out, forgotten, and good-for-nothing trash as he
was, yet they live in fair repute and never see themselves for what
they are. And why should my poor puppet be the only one to know himself
and perish for it?’”</p>

<p>Coxcombry and charlatanism, then, are the butt of Hawthorne’s satire in
his <i>Legend</i>. The nature of his theme, however, is susceptible of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
application far less restricted, a development far more universal, than
such satire. This wider issue once or twice in his sketch he seems to
have touched upon, only immediately to ignore again. Thus, in the very
last paragraph, Mother Rigby exclaims: “Poor Feathertop! I could easily
give him another chance and send him forth again to-morrow. But no!
<i>His feelings are too tender—his sensibilities too deep.</i>”</p>

<p>In these words, spoken in irony, Hawthorne ends his narrative with an
undeveloped aspect of his theme, which constitutes the starting-point
of the conception of my play: the aspect, namely, of the essential
<i>tragedy of the ludicrous</i>; an aspect which, in its development,
inevitably predicates for my play a divergent treatment and a different
conclusion. The element of human sympathy is here substituted for that
of irony, as criterion of the common absurdity of mankind.</p>

<p>The scarecrow Feathertop is ridiculous, as the emblem of a superficial
fop; the scarecrow Ravensbane is pitiful, as the emblem of human bathos.</p>

<p>Compared with our own ideas of human perfection, what human rubbish
we are! Of what incongruous elements are we constructed by time and
inheritance wherewith to realize the reasonableness, the power, the
altruism, of our dreams! What absurdity is our highest consummation!
Yet the sense of our common deficiency is, after all, our salvation.
<i>There</i> is one reality which is a basic hope for the realization of
those dreams. This sense is human sympathy, which is, it would seem, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
more searching critic of human frailty than satire. It is the growth
of this sense which dowers with dignity and reality the hollowest and
most ludicrous of mankind, and becomes in such a fundamental grace of
character. In a recent critical interpretation of Cervantes’ great
work, Professor G. E. Woodberry writes: “A madman has no character; but
it is the character of Don Quixote that at last draws the knight out of
all his degradations and makes him triumph in the heart of the reader.”
And he continues: “Modern dismay begins in the thought that here is not
the abnormality of an individual, but the madness of the soul in its
own nature.”</p>

<p>If for “madness” in this quotation I may be permitted to substitute
<i>ludicrousness</i> (or <i>incongruity</i>), a more felicitous expression of my
meaning, as applied to Ravensbane in this play, would be difficult to devise.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will, I trust, be the more clearly
apparent why “The Scarecrow” cannot with any appropriateness be deemed
a dramatization of “Feathertop,” and why its manifold divergencies from
the latter in treatment and motive cannot with any just significance
be considered as liberties taken with an original source. Dickon, for
example, whose name in the <i>Legend</i> is but a momentary invocation
in the mouth of Mother Rigby, becomes in my play not merely the
characterized visible associate of Goody Rickby (“Blacksmith Bess”),
but the necessary foil of sceptical irony to the human growth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
scarecrow. So, too, for reasons of the play’s different intent, Goody
Rickby herself is differentiated from Mother Rigby; and Rachel Merton
has no motive, of character or artistic design, in common with pretty,
affected Polly Gookin.</p>

<p>My indebtedness to the New England master in literature is, needless
to say, gratefully acknowledged; but it is fitting, I think, to
distinguish clearly between the aim and the scope of “Feathertop” and
that of the play in hand, as much in deference to the work of Hawthorne
as in comprehension of the spirit of my own.</p>

“THE MOST NOTABLE ADDITION MADE TO AMERICAN<br />DRAMATIC LITERATURE IN MANY YEARS.”</p></div>

<p><b><big>Mr. PERCY MACKAYE’S</big>&emsp;new drama</b></p>
<p class="author"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 net;</i></p>
<p><big><b>Sappho and Phaon</b></big></p>
<p class="author"><i>by mail, $1.35</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">“Mr. MacKaye’s work is the most notable addition
that has been made for many years to American dramatic literature. It
is true poetic tragedy ... charged with happy inspiration; dignified,
eloquent, passionate, imaginative, and thoroughly human in its emotions
... and whether considered in the light of literature or drama need
not fear comparison with anything that has been written by Stephen
Phillips or John Davidson ... masterfully written with deep pathos and
unmistakable poetic power.”—<i>New York Evening Post.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"> The critic of the <i>Boston Transcript</i> says: “Mr.
MacKaye has planned his scheme with both the exactitude of the stage
director and the imagination of the poet.... We remember no drama
by any modern writer that at once seems so readable and so actable,
and no play that is so excellent in stage technique, so clear in
characterization, and so completely filled with the atmosphere of
romance and poetry.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">“... The force and vigor, and beautiful imagery,
of Mr. MacKaye’s happy experiment in classic form are evident. It is
finer and stronger, better knit, than his ‘Jeanne d’Arc,’ which Sothern
and Marlowe have found an acceptable addition to their repertory....
This play is high-water mark in American dramatic verse.”—<i>Boston
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent">“Mr. MacKaye’s verse is varied, virile, and
essentially dramatic, with here and there bits which stand out with
rare beauty.”—<i>New York Dramatic Mirror.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent">“It has beauty of spirit, grace and distinction of
style, and power enough to commend it to a friendly reading by lovers
of dramatic writing.”—<i>Daily Eagle.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent">“Many are awakening to the somewhat incredulous
but curiously persistent feeling that in ‘Sappho and Phaon’ Mr. MacKaye
has achieved a <i>tour de force</i> which will be read with admiration for
some time to come.”—<i>The World To-Day.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent">“Interesting for the dramatic beauty of some of
its passages, for the originality of its conception, and as a curiosity
of playwriting.... The tragic conception, the shipwreck of the ideal
in its passionate self-emancipation from reality, is Greek to the
core.”—<i>Churchman.</i></p>

<p class="f120"><b>Mr. PERCY MACKAYE</b></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><big><b>Jeanne d’Arc</b></big></p>
<p class=" blockquot2 no-indent">“A series of scenes animated at times
by a sure, direct, and simple poetry, again by the militant fire,
and finally by the bitter pathos of the most moving, perhaps the
most beautiful, and certainly the most inexplicable story in profane
history.”—<i>Philadelphia Ledger.</i></p>

<p class=" blockquot2 no-indent">“A singularly fresh, buoyant treatment
of an old subject, Mr. Mackaye’s ‘Jeanne d’Arc’ contains less pageantry
and more spirituality than any of the plays about the Maid since
Schiller.”—<i>Record-Herald</i>, Chicago.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><big><b>Fenris the Wolf</b></big></p>
<p class=" blockquot2 no-indent">“A drama that shows triple greatness.
There is the supreme beauty of poetry, the perfect sense of dramatic
proportion, and nobility of purpose. It is a work to dream over, to
make one see glorious pictures,—a work to uplift to soul heights
through its marvellously wrought sense appeal.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><big><b>The Canterbury Pilgrims</b></big></p>
<p class=" blockquot2 no-indent">“This is a comedy in four acts,—a
comedy in the higher and better meaning of the term. It is an original
conception worked out with a rare degree of freshness and buoyancy,
and it may honestly be called a play of unusual interest and unusual
literary merit.... The drama might well be called a character portrait
of Chaucer, for it shows him forth with keen discernment, a captivating
figure among men, an intensely human, vigorous, kindly man.... It is a
moving, vigorous play in action. Things go rapidly and happily, and,
while there are many passages of real poetry, the book is essentially a
drama.”—<i>St. Paul Dispatch.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot2 no-indent">Mr. Richard Le Gallienne in the <i>North
American Review</i> pointed out recently “their spontaneous power and
freshness, their imaginative vision, their lyrical magic.” He adds:
“Mr. Noyes is surprisingly various. I have seldom read one book,
particularly by so young a writer, in which so many different things
are done, and all done so well.... But that for which one is most
grateful to Mr. Noyes in his strong and brilliant treatment of all his
rich material, is the gift by which, in my opinion, he stands alone
among the younger poets of the day, his lyrical gift.”</p>

songs at first for the pure music of their rhythm, later because of
the deep embodied truths rather divined than comprehended.... Mr.
Noyes is first of all a singer, then something of a seer with great
love and high hopes and aims to balance this rare combination. Of
course ultramaterialists will pull his latest book to pieces, from
the frank preface to the dedication which follows the last chapter.
But readers of more gentle fibre will find it not only full of rich
imagery and refreshing interest, but also a wonderful passport to the

of us, having left it far behind, would so gladly regain.”—<i>Chicago

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
